ðŸ”¹ Database Setup
The project uses MySQL to store client inquiries, event bookings, and package information.
Tables:
users â€“ Stores client details
events â€“ Stores event types and packages
inquiries â€“ Stores inquiries submitted via the form
bookings â€“ Stores confirmed bookings

Database Connectivity: Configured via application.properties in Spring Boot backend:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/celebrato_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

Note: You need a local MySQL server to run the backend. Without a live MySQL instance, the backend cannot fully function online.

ðŸ”¹ How to Run Locally

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/celebrato.git

Set up MySQL Database:
Create a database celebrato_db
Import any SQL script if provided or let Hibernate auto-create tables

Configure backend:
Update application.properties with your DB credentials

Run backend:
mvn spring-boot:run

Open frontend:
Use Live Server in VS Code to serve index.html and other pages

ðŸ”¹ Live Demo Limitation

Currently, the live demo is not available because the project requires a MySQL database, which cannot be freely hosted online alongside GitHub Pages. Form submissions and database-dependent features will not work without a backend server connected to a live database.

Recommendation:
Run locally with backend + MySQL to see full functionality
Alternatively, deploy backend on platforms like Render or Heroku and connect to a cloud MySQL service like Remote MySQL for a fully live demo
